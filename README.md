# Expense Tracker App
This app helps me and my wife track our expenses efficiently. Built with React, Vite, and Firestore. 

Hope you have a great day with your wife! ðŸ˜Š

# Development Guide
## Git `commit` message rules
- Install some package like `npm install foo` then: "Install foo package"
- Add some features or updates then: "Add some features"
- Change something already built: "Change a to b"
- Remove something: "Remove variable myVar"

Let me know if there's someting better ^_^

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
